# 🤔 Is it Wednesday?

Let's answer the most pressing question of the day: **[guiruggiero.com/wednesdaychecker](https://guiruggiero.com/wednesdaychecker?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wednesdaychecker)**

Built by [Gui Ruggiero](https://guiruggiero.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wednesdaychecker) with [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) on a weekday evening during COVID (February 2021) as a joke with friends. Because sometimes, getting over the hump day is all that matters.

(At this point, this is just a desperate attempt at justifying the (little) time invested in building such a crucial piece of software 🤪)
